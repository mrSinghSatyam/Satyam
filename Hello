# Introduction

- Graphic point is a large format printing company based in Ashford, Kent, UK.
- They are in need of making an online portal to let their customers purchase online without having to call them. This way the customer can view the product and check prices on the go.
- As this based in the UK and supply products only to nearby destinations we'll be focusing on creating the portal UK specific (spellings and currency).
  > **Important** - Graphic Point wants the portal to be user-specific
      By user-specific, we mean user from a different Company (Graphic Point's customer) see products specific to their respective Company only.
- For now we are only focusing on signages which has 619 signages across 13 categories. Graphic Point would be growing this online portal to add products beyond Signages to Banners, Pull up banners, Merchandise (stationary etc)
- The signage which go the online portal are printed in variety of materials(substrate) such as
  - 3MM Foamex
  - 1 mm Foamex
  - 4mm Correx
  - Self adhesive vinyl
  - Aluminium Composite with Channel
  - Aluminium Composite with Drill Holes
  - Aluminium Composite Without Drill Holes
  - PVC Banner
  - PVC Banner Mesh
- Each for these materials (substrate) have a different cost, hence the final product cost would be different if signs are printed with different materials.
- As this an online portal, Graphic Point would ofcourse want to know who placed the order and whom to deliver? For this Graphic Point needs an Admin login to the online portal.
